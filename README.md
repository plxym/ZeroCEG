## How It Works

1. **PDF Processing**: The application automatically reads all PDF files from the `pdfs/` directory and extracts their text content.

2. **Event Discovery**: Events are automatically discovered based on the PDF filenames in the directory.

3. **AI Integration**: Uses the Puter API (free OpenAI-compatible API) to provide intelligent responses based on the PDF content.

4. **Context-Aware Chat**: The AI assistant has access to the complete event guide content and can answer specific questions about rules, requirements, and judging criteria.

## API Configuration

The application uses the Puter API for AI responses. No API key is required as it's a free service. The API endpoint is configured in `app.py`:

```python
'https://api.puter.com/v1/chat/completions'
